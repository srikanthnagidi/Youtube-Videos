Using a gnotobiotic mouse model, in which animals were colonized with a synthetic human gut microbiota composed of fully sequenced commensal bacteria, we elucidated the functional interactions between dietary fiber, the gut microbiota, and the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a primary defense against enteric pathogens. We show that during chronic or intermittent dietary fiber deficiency, the gut microbiota resorts to host-secreted mucus glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier. Dietary fiber deprivation, together with a fiber-deprived, mucus-eroding microbiota, promotes greater epithelial access and lethal colitis by the mucosal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Our work reveals intricate pathways linking diet, the gut microbiome, and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which could be exploited to improve health using dietary therapeutics.", "context": {"all": {"count": 13189185, "mean": 7.9829682865783, "rank": 9483, "pct": 99, "higher_than": 13179823}, "journal": {"count": 14819, "mean": 28.556901066271, "rank": 73, "pct": 99, "higher_than": 14746}, "similar_age_3m": {"count": 368930, "mean": 11.59497189432, "rank": 636, "pct": 99, "higher_than": 368294}, "similar_age_journal_3m": {"count": 159, "mean": 129.01687341772, "rank": 8, "pct": 94, "higher_than": 151}}, "authors": ["Mahesh S.

In some cases, these delayed results of your dietary changes may even discourage you from sticking with the diet, eventually causing you to give into temptation.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s important that we feel good when we change our eating habits. What many of us don\u2019t know is that we can poorly digest some food which creates a buildup of mucus in our colon.\n \nColonic mucus, if accumulated, can cause numerous problems like: energy loss, weight gain, and even headaches.\n\nSo, improving the intestinal process helps not only improve your overall health, but also accelerates the weight loss process.\n\nTo perform this cleansing procedure, all you need to do is eat vegetables or fresh fruits and focus on foods that are rich in fiber and other nutrients.\n\nA well-balanced diet will take care of the cleansing process, however, there is also another option to speed up the process. It\u2019s an apple-based recipe.\n\nBeing rich in fiber, the apple helps stave off hunger pains, as well as to eliminate the toxins from the body. Remember, we\u2019ve got to drink plenty of water to avoid constipation.\n\nIn addition to the apple, we should also consume flax seed. It has the power to improve the absorption of nutrients in the digestive tract, helping to delay gastric emptying. Flaxseed contains properties that act as antioxidants and prevent heart disease.\n\nIn addition to flaxseeds and apple seeds, we also have the properties of chia, which, being rich in fiber, promotes a healthy digestive system and also helps weight loss. Chia also promotes a healthy heart. \n\nSo, let\u2019s learn how to properly mix these three foods and how to use them in a meaningful way in your diet in order to lose weight:\n\nIngredients\n\n1 medium apple\n1 tablespoon freshly ground flaxseed;\n1 tablespoon chia seeds\n1 teaspoon of honey\n1 cup water\n\nInstructions\n\nMix all of the ingredients, except for the chia seeds, in the blender. Add the chia and let the mixture rest for about five minutes or until you see that the chia seeds have begun to swell.\n\nSee how easy it is? This recipe will helps you feel full and will help to cleanse your digestive tract effectively by speeding up the weight loss process.\n\nBesides that, it\u2019s great. So, enjoy and supercharge your diet!\n\nReference(s):\n\n\nResource(s):\n\n\nFor more information and references, check the article on our blog:\n\n\nDisclaimer: The materials and the information contained on Natural Cures channel are provided for general and educational purposes only and do not constitute any legal, medical or other professional advice on any subject matter.
